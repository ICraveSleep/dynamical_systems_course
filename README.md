# Differential Equations & Dynamic Systems #

This repository is used to exercise the topics presented by
Steve Brunton in his course on _Differential Equations & Dynamic Systems_. 
As described by the course title, the course presents a comprehensive introduction and overview to Differential Equations & Dynamical Systems.  

Dynamical systems are differential equations that describe any system that changes in time.  Applications include 
fluid dynamics, elasticity and vibrations, weather and climate systems, epidemiology, 
biomechanics, space mission design, and control theory.
